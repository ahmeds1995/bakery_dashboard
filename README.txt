Happy to share this dashboard which shows some analysis about transactions within a bakery in 2017.

Project Processes: 

1 - Data Collection: I downloaded the dataset file from kaggle in csv.
2- Data Exploratory :  Understand the data, and what is it talking about, and the content of every column.
3- Data Cleaning : Check blanks and duplicates, and normalize date column.	
4- Data Analysis: Create measures to have insights about total transactions, total items sold, and average number of  transactions per month.
Also, I extracted the relationship between the pairs of sold items in what is called the "Frequency Co-occurrence"
5- Data Visualization : Finally, I created an interactive dashboard which shows the findings in a visual form.

Software Used:
 1- MySQL Workbranch : For data exploratory, and data cleaning processes.
 2- Power BI Desktop : For data trsformation, data analysis, and data visualizaion by creating an interactive dashboard.
